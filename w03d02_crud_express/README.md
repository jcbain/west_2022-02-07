# W03D02 - CRUD with Express

### Objectives
- [X] Implement CRUD over HTTP with Express
- [X] Render data fro the user using EJS templates
- [X] Use forms to submit HTTP requests
- [X] Explore the Post-Redirect-Get pattern
- [X] Use Chrome DevTools to see requests and responses
- [X] Pracitice debugging Express



## What is CRUD? 

Crud refers to the ways that a user can interact with a resource

- C => Create
- R => Read
- U => Update
- D => Delete

However, another acronym that you may see thrown around is BREAD

- B => Browse
- R => Read
- E => Edit
- A => Add
- D => Delete

## Our resource

* Pencils
  - isSharp: boolean
  - color: string
  - type: string

## EJS

stands for embedded javascript

What's the difference between `<% %>` and `<%= %>`?
- `<%= %>` will output the javascript
- `<% %>` just for logic but don't want to output

### Routes

* A route is made up of a **VERB** and a **PATH**.
* Verbs: **GET**, **POST**, **PUT**, **PATCH**, **DELETE**
* Path: `example.com`**/resource**, `example.com`**/resource/:id**

### Forms vs Anchor Tags
* Anchor tags (`<a></a>`) only make `GET` requests
  * Anchor tags are generally used to link between websites or to different pages on the same site
* Forms can make either `GET` or `POST` requests (specified in the form's `method` attribute)
  * Forms are used to collect and submit user information
* If data is being retrieved, use a `GET` request
* If data is being updated/changed/created, use a `POST` request (therefore, a form)
  * NOTE: This includes things like buttons to delete a resource (simply wrap the button in a form)
